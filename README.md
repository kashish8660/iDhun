# iDhun
iDhun is an application designed as a music player. Upon launching the application, it requests permission to access the local storage of the mobile device, enabling it to scan and retrieve all available songs stored in the device.

These songs are then presented and organized in a RecyclerView, providing a convenient and structured view for the user.

Within the application, users have the ability to control playback functionalities, including play, pause, skip to the next or previous song.

A seekbar dynamically represents the progress of the currently playing song in real-time, allowing users to visualize how much of the song has been completed.

The name of the currently playing song is displayed as scrolling text, ensuring readability and facilitating the identification of the playing track.
